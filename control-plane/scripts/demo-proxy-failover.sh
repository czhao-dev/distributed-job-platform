# remaining healthy nodes, then restarts the node and shows it rejoin
# rotation. Run ./run-local-cluster.sh first.
#
# Note: the node agent isn't a pod-serving HTTP service (pods run as
# subprocesses) -- its small metrics listener's /readyz endpoint stands in
# as "traffic" here, which is enough to demonstrate health-aware routing and
# failover without conflating it with a real pod workload's behavior.
